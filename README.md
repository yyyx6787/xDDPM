# xDDPM: Explainable Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for scientific modeling
## Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, in Pytorch

Implementation of xDDPM: Explainable Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for scientific modelingin Pytorch. First diffusion-based model for explainable generation. We introduce a simple variant to the DDPM method that incorporates Information Bottleneck for attribution and is able to generate samples that exclusively contain the signal-relevant components.


## Install

```bash
$ pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from denoising_diffusion_pytorch import Unet, GaussianDiffusion

model = Unet(
    dim = 64,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    flash_attn = True
)

diffusion = GaussianDiffusion(
    model,
    image_size = 128,
    timesteps = 1000    # number of steps
)

training_images = torch.rand(8, 3, 128, 128) # images are normalized from 0 to 1
loss = diffusion(training_images)
loss.backward()

# after a lot of training

sampled_images = diffusion.sample(batch_size = 4)
sampled_images.shape # (4, 3, 128, 128)
```

Or, if you simply want to pass in a folder name and the desired image dimensions, you can use the `Trainer` class to easily train a model.

```python
from denoising_diffusion_pytorch import Unet, GaussianDiffusion, Trainer

model = Unet(
    dim = 64,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    flash_attn = True
)

diffusion = GaussianDiffusion(
    model,
    image_size = 128,
    timesteps = 1000,           # number of steps
    sampling_timesteps = 250    # number of sampling timesteps (using ddim for faster inference [see citation for ddim paper])
)

trainer = Trainer(
    diffusion,
    'path/to/your/images',
    train_batch_size = 32,
    train_lr = 8e-5,
    train_num_steps = 700000,         # total training steps
    gradient_accumulate_every = 2,    # gradient accumulation steps
    ema_decay = 0.995,                # exponential moving average decay
    amp = True,                       # turn on mixed precision
    calculate_fid = True              # whether to calculate fid during training
)

trainer.train()
```

Samples and model checkpoints will be logged to `./results` periodically

## Multi-GPU Training

The `Trainer` class is now equipped with <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/accelerator">ðŸ¤— Accelerator</a>. You can easily do multi-gpu training in two steps using their `accelerate` CLI

At the project root directory, where the training script is, run

```python
$ accelerate config
```

Then, in the same directory

```python
$ accelerate launch train.py
```
